# Reloproxy
## What is reloproxy?
Reloproxy is a revolutionary dual flask-express app that is built to have the frontend and backend be controlled by node, with the flexibility of python on the static file side.

## Installtion (the long part)
Since this part is only consistent of unlicensed components, you may go grab a server for ultraviolet and stuff from a completely unrelated `https://github.com/reloverse/ultraviolet-unix-socket`. Then you can direct it to make a socket in this directory called uv.sock, and run. It will hopefully work.
